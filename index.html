      <br>

      <p>I am a 4 year old Shepherd mix currently residing near the big apple. I am curious by nature but also a scaredy cat. I love humans a lot however at times, I can be unsure of other fur babies. It will take me some time to warm up to them, especially if they are smaller or much larger than me.

      <br><br>

      I am 100% food motivated however I can compromise when it comes to rubber balls and soft, stuffed toys. I will fall head over heels for you if you give me mozzarella string cheese though.
